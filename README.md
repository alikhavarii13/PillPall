# PillPall

PillPall is a Flutter medication companion that helps you stay on top of your
prescriptions. Save pill details, configure how long and how often you need to
take them, and receive scheduled reminders thanks to local notifications and
timezone-aware scheduling. The app stores entries locally with `sqflite` and
uses Riverpod for state management, making it easy to review, edit, or delete
reminders whenever your regimen changes.
