In this file I will provide the documentation about how my code works with details

This app inspired its architecture from compass app which is one of the flutter samples

I am using Riverpod for state management, Supabase as the backend and auth, Sqflite for offline DB, Dio for network,

shared preference for saving token

Based on Flutter documentation structuring your app feature base is recommended.
